# AWS CLI in Docker with Docker

Containerized AWS CLI to avoid requiring the aws cli to be installed on CI machines.
Docker is also installed inside this image and allow docker-in-docker CI pipelines.

## Build

```
docker build -t mesosphere/aws-cli .
```

Automated build on Docker Hub

[![DockerHub Badge](http://dockeri.co/image/mesosphere/aws-cli)](https://hub.docker.com/r/mesosphere/aws-cli/)

## Usage

Configure:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<id>"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<key>"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="<region>"
```

Upload file to S3:

```
./aws.sh s3 cp ../dcos-centos-virtualbox-0.2.1.box s3://downloads.dcos.io/dcos-vagrant/
```

Caveat: Because `aws.sh` mounts the current directory as `/project`, paths to local files must be relative to the current directory.

## Install

To use `aws.sh` as a drop-in replacement for calls to the aws-cli, use one of the following methods:

Add an alias to your shell:

```
alias aws='docker run --rm -t $(tty &>/dev/null && echo "-i") -e "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}" -e "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}" -e "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}" -v "$(pwd):/project" mesosphere/aws-cli'
```

Or drop it into your path named `aws`:

```
curl -o /usr/local/bin/aws https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mesosphere/aws-cli/master/aws.sh && chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/aws
```

## Maintenance 

- The Docker image build & publish is automated by DockerHub for master commits and tags.
- The awscli and s3cmd packages have handcoded versions in the Dockerfile that need to be bumped manually.
